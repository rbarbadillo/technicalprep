# datastructures_algorithms

This repository includes basic data structures and algorithms implemented with Python. It is intended to reflect on my technical interview preparation.

## Disclaimer

The vast majority of problems and implementations are originally solved by me.
However, in the instances where I have taken code from other people, I have tried to credit them all but since I did not start this with the intention of sharing it, I may have forgotten it on occasion. If you find something without credit, I would appreciate it if you let me know. Thank you in advance.
