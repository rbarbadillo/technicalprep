# If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
#  Breadth first search (BFS)

# If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
# BFS. DFS would take a really long time. There are also memory concerns with BFS.

# //If the tree is very wide:
# // Depth first search (DFS). A BFS would need too much memory.

# //If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
# // DFS.

# //Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
# // DFS

# //Finding the shortest path:
# // BFS
